  "summary": "This section provides a synthesized interpretation of India's macroeconomic aggregates from 2011–12 onward, integrating the dashboard's analyses on GDP, inflation, expenditure structure, and sectoral dynamics. It connects statistical observations to broader economic narratives, helping users understand not just what changed, but why.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "What is the difference between GDP and GVA?",
      "a": "GVA measures the value generated by industries at basic prices, while GDP adds product taxes and subtracts subsidies. In India’s recent data, GVA trends mirror GDP but show slightly lower volatility. The difference widened after 2017, reflecting rising net taxes as fiscal revenue increased relative to output."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why does GDP have ‘current’ and ‘constant’ prices?",
      "a": "GDP at current prices includes inflation effects, while constant prices use 2011–12 as the base year to reflect real production growth. Between 2012 and 2024, nominal GDP nearly quadrupled, but real GDP only doubled—showing how inflation and price levels amplify nominal figures over time."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the GDP deflator?",
      "a": "The deflator is an implicit measure of inflation derived from the ratio of nominal to real GDP. Its steady climb through the 2010s, and surge around 2021–22, reveals broad-based price pressures that affected all sectors—not just consumer goods—highlighting how aggregate inflation exceeded CPI during supply disruptions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why did GDP drop sharply in 2020–21?",
      "a": "The 2020–21 contraction represents the COVID-19 impact. Real GDP declined almost 7%, with the services sector collapsing and industry output turning negative. It was India’s sharpest modern downturn, followed by a strong rebound in 2021–22 as restrictions eased and base effects inflated recovery numbers."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which sector drives India’s GDP the most?",
      "a": "Services dominate India’s economy, contributing over half of total real output. Industry’s share has been roughly one-third, while agriculture remains below 10%. This structural pattern shows a clear long-term tilt toward service-led growth with steady urbanization and digital expansion."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does CPI differ from the GDP deflator?",
      "a": "CPI tracks retail prices faced by consumers, while the GDP deflator covers all goods and services produced domestically. CPI rose consistently, but the deflator often increased faster, especially after 2021, because investment and intermediate goods saw steeper price hikes than household consumption."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why does nominal GDP grow faster than real GDP?",
      "a": "Nominal GDP includes inflation, so when prices rise, it overstates real economic expansion. The persistent gap between nominal and real GDP growth across 2015–2024 shows that roughly one-third of India’s headline growth in recent years came from price effects rather than higher output."
    },
    {
      "q": "What caused the inflation spike around 2021–22?",
      "a": "The 2021–22 inflation spike stemmed from global commodity shortages, supply bottlenecks, and recovery demand. The GDP deflator and CPI both jumped sharply, but nominal GDP surged even more, showing how inflation temporarily inflated growth rates while real expansion remained moderate."
    },
    {
      "q": "What do the inflation ‘regimes’ represent?",
      "a": "The regimes classify inflation environments into low, moderate, and high clusters. Low regimes dominated between 2015–2019, while 2021–22 and 2022–23 fall under high inflation clusters. These transitions highlight macro volatility and the cyclical nature of India’s price dynamics post-2019."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is inflation expected to stabilize?",
      "a": "Forecasts indicate a moderate and steady inflation path. The GDP deflator’s projected increase flattens toward 2026, implying that while prices continue to rise, the pace of inflation is expected to stabilize around the mid-single digits—consistent with a normalized post-shock economy."
    },
    {
      "q": "What does PFCE stand for?",
      "a": "PFCE represents private household consumption and remains India’s main growth engine. It consistently accounts for about 60% of nominal GDP, underscoring how domestic consumption—rather than investment or exports—drives the bulk of aggregate demand."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is GFCE?",
      "a": "GFCE is government final consumption expenditure, representing public spending on goods and services. Its share, around 10% of GDP, rose slightly after 2020 as fiscal stimulus expanded to offset pandemic disruptions."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is GFCF?",
      "a": "GFCF stands for gross fixed capital formation—investment in assets like infrastructure and machinery. After a slowdown between 2017 and 2020, investment recovered sharply post-pandemic, reflecting both base effects and renewed capital spending momentum."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is Net Exports negative?",
      "a": "India consistently imports more than it exports, keeping net exports negative throughout the period. While exports have grown, import intensity in energy and capital goods ensures a structural trade deficit, slightly narrowing only in high-growth or weak-demand years."
    },
    {
      "q": "How has the expenditure structure changed?",
      "a": "The expenditure mix remained stable—PFCE dominant, GFCF growing slightly, and net exports negative. The gradual rise of investment share post-2020 indicates a mild rebalancing toward capital formation, though consumption still drives the majority of GDP."
    },
    {
      "q": "What does per-capita income indicate?",
      "a": "Per-capita income tracks average nominal income per person. Between 2012 and 2024, it tripled, signaling strong nominal growth. However, when adjusted for inflation, real income gains are smaller, showing moderate improvement in actual purchasing power."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why did per-capita income dip around 2020–21?",
      "a": "That dip directly mirrors the COVID contraction. Economic shutdowns led to widespread income losses and employment declines, especially in services. It was the only visible fall in an otherwise rising income trajectory."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is income growth keeping up with inflation?",
      "a": "Not entirely. Although nominal incomes rose sharply, inflation eroded part of the gain. Real per-capita growth averaged 4–5%, while nominal growth exceeded 8%, revealing that price increases absorbed roughly half of apparent income improvements."
    },
    {
      "q": "What models are used in this dashboard?",
      "a": "The dashboard integrates two analytical layers: Prophet for time-series forecasting of GDP and the GDP deflator, and K-Means clustering for inflation regime identification. Both models enhance interpretability without overcomplicating inference."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the data sources?",
      "a": "All data originate from India’s official National Accounts Statistics (MOSPI, base 2011–12). Aggregates from p-1 to p-12 cover GDP, GVA, expenditure, prices, and per-capita metrics. The data were cleaned and merged to enable consistent year-wise analysis."
