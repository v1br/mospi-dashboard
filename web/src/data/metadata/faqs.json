  "summary": "This section provides a synthesized interpretation of India's macroeconomic aggregates from 2011–12 onward, integrating the dashboard's analyses on GDP, inflation, expenditure structure, and sectoral dynamics. It connects statistical observations to broader economic narratives, helping users understand not just what changed, but why.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "What is the difference between GDP and GVA?",
      "a": "GVA measures the value generated by industries at basic prices, while GDP adds product taxes and subtracts subsidies. In India’s recent data, GVA trends mirror GDP but show slightly lower volatility. The difference widened after 2017, reflecting rising net taxes as fiscal revenue increased relative to output."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why does GDP have ‘current’ and ‘constant’ prices?",
      "a": "GDP at current prices includes inflation effects, while constant prices use 2011–12 as the base year to reflect real production growth. Between 2012 and 2024, nominal GDP nearly quadrupled, but real GDP only doubled—showing how inflation and price levels amplify nominal figures over time."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the GDP deflator?",
      "a": "The deflator is an implicit measure of inflation derived from the ratio of nominal to real GDP. Its steady climb through the 2010s, and surge around 2021–22, reveals broad-based price pressures that affected all sectors—not just consumer goods—highlighting how aggregate inflation exceeded CPI during supply disruptions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why did GDP drop sharply in 2020–21?",
      "a": "The 2020–21 contraction represents the COVID-19 impact. Real GDP declined almost 7%, with the services sector collapsing and industry output turning negative. It was India’s sharpest modern downturn, followed by a strong rebound in 2021–22 as restrictions eased and base effects inflated recovery numbers."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which sector drives India’s GDP the most?",
      "a": "Services dominate India’s economy, contributing over half of total real output. Industry’s share has been roughly one-third, while agriculture remains below 10%. This structural pattern shows a clear long-term tilt toward service-led growth with steady urbanization and digital expansion."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does CPI differ from the GDP deflator?",
      "a": "CPI tracks retail prices faced by consumers, while the GDP deflator covers all goods and services produced domestically. CPI rose consistently, but the deflator often increased faster, especially after 2021, because investment and intermediate goods saw steeper price hikes than household consumption."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why does nominal GDP grow faster than real GDP?",
      "a": "Nominal GDP includes inflation, so when prices rise, it overstates real economic expansion. The persistent gap between nominal and real GDP growth across 2015–2024 shows that roughly one-third of India’s headline growth in recent years came from price effects rather than higher output."
    },
    {
      "q": "What caused the inflation spike around 2021–22?",
      "a": "The 2021–22 inflation spike stemmed from global commodity shortages, supply bottlenecks, and recovery demand. The GDP deflator and CPI both jumped sharply, but nominal GDP surged even more, showing how inflation temporarily inflated growth rates while real expansion remained moderate."
